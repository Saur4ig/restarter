A simple solution for small projects that want auto-deploy, but they do not have enough resources for serious services.

You need to specify the folder in which the project sources are located, add git credentials to config(if needed), add endpoint and secret key in which the generated token will be sent, and then add the command to rebuild the project.

Easy to use - setup your config and make it alive using `make run` or any you want
